Key Analysis Performed
âœ… Data Cleaning & Preparation

Processed dataset to remove inconsistencies and missing values.
Defined the independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables for regression analysis.
âœ… Simple Linear Regression Model

Applied SLR formula: Y = Î²0 + Î²1X + Îµ, where Î²0 is the intercept and Î²1 is the slope.
Used Statistical Measures such as p-value, RÂ² score, and standard error to evaluate model accuracy.
âœ… Model Performance & Interpretation

RÂ² Score: Measures how well the independent variable explains the variation in the dependent variable.
P-value Analysis: Determines the significance of the relationship between X and Y.
Regression Coefficients: Shows the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable.
Key Insights & Conclusions
ðŸ“Œ Identified whether a strong or weak correlation exists between the two variables.
ðŸ“Œ Evaluated the modelâ€™s effectiveness using statistical metrics.
ðŸ“Œ Suggested improvements for better predictive accuracy in future regression models.
